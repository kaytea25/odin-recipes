        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Scallion pancakes are a savory Chinese flatbread made from dough and filled with chopped scallions. They are pan-fried until crispy and golden brown.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups boiling water</li>
            <li>2 tbsps vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tsps vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a fork to mix flour and boiling water in a large bowl. Knead dough into a ball.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap; let dough rest for 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Evenly divide dough into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/4 inch thick circle. Brush each circle with oil, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of green onions.</li>
            <li>Roll up, cigar style; coil each pancake and pinch open ends together to form a disc. Roll each circle flat to about 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet. Fry cakes until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Add more oil between batches, if necessary.</li>
        </ol>

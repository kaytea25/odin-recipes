            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 whole chicken parts, totaling about 2 lbs</li>
                <li>1 1-inch pc ginger</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>1 cup Shaoxing rice wine</li>
                <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken and ginger in a medium saucepan. Add enough cold water to barely cover chicken. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat then reduce to lowest heat.</li>
                <li>Cook until chicken is cooked through. Remove each piece as they cook through to a bowl. When all chicken is cooked, pour broth over chicken in bowl.</li>
                <li>Let chicken and broth cool. Chop chicken into 1-inch- to 1/2-inch pieces, depending on the cut of the chicken</li>
                <li>Find a nonreactive container that snugly fits all chicken pieces. Place all the chicken in the container, taking care not to cram the pieces. Season with salt.</li>
                <li>Combine chicken broth and wine, and pour over chicken until completely covered. Marinate for at least 24 hours, and up to 5 days. Serve cold.</li>
            </ol>
